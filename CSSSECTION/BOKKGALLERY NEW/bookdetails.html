                <P>
                    Pride and Prejudice is an 1813 romantic novel of manners written by Jane Austen. The novel follows
                    the character development of Elizabeth Bennet, the dynamic protagonist of the book who learns about
                    the repercussions of hasty judgments and comes to appreciate the difference between superficial
                    goodness and actual goodness. Its humour lies in its honest depiction of manners, education,
                    marriage, and money during the Regency era in England.
