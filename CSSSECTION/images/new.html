    <h1 id="h1"> Tourism</h1>
    <p>According to the Tourism Society of Britain,” tourism is the temporary short-period movement of people to
        destination outside the places where they normally live, work; and activities during their stay at these
        destinations.” This definition includes the movement of people for all purposes. .</p>

    <p>Tourism is travel for pleasure or business; also the theory and practice of touring, the business of attracting,
        accommodating, and entertaining tourists, and the business of operating tours.[2] The World Tourism Organization
        defines tourism more generally, in terms which go "beyond the common perception of tourism as being limited to
        holiday activity only", as people "traveling to and staying in places outside their usual environment for not
        more than one consecutive year for leisure and not less than 24 hours, business and other purposes".[3] Tourism
        can be domestic (within the traveller's own country) or international, and international tourism has both
        incoming and outgoing implications on a country's balance of payments</p>
